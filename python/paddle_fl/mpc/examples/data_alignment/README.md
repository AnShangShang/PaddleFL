## Data Alignment

### 1. Introduction

Data alignment is used for alignment of data set owned by multi parties without leaking any privacy information of data. Concretely, all data of data owners are numbered the same number for the same data. When align, all data owners input the set of data number and get a set of number for the intersection.



### 2. Example

Here is an example for data alignment between two parties. The `align.py` is a script used for  each party. The set of data number of the two parties are saved in `data_0.txt` and `data_1.txt` respectively. You can directly run `run.sh` for running this example in single machine.
